The Armored Squid Project
=========================

*This is a working concept of the Armored Squid project game.*

The ideas proposed here are flexible and will likely change drastically throughout the course of the project. These concepts will be especially fluid for the first week or so while the core concept of the game is thought out. Feel free to offer ideas in the form of changes on any of the ideas presented here.

The core concepts are the exception. Most of the details of that aspect of the project are unlikely to change. Nothing, however, is set in stone.


## Core Concepts

- The Armored Squid project is a combat card game of some sort.
- This will be primarily a multiplayer game, though there will be a first-player component and likely a campaign.
- As with any card game of this sort, players' card collections will be persistent.
- Eventually, our goal is to release the game on multiple platforms. First we will focus on Windows alone. Then we'll move to others.
	- Primary platforms
		- Windows
		- Linux
		- iOS
	- Secondary platforms
		- OSX
		- Android


## Game Mechanics

### Cards
Nearly everything involved in gameplay will be card-based. There will be different types of cards for the various aspects of the game:
	
- Character cards
- Equipment cards
	- Weapons
	- Armor
	- Accessories
- Ability cards
- Stat-boosting cards

Mechanically, the character cards are the game's core cards. They are the cards onto which all other cards are attached.

In the interest of game dynamics, combat should involve each player controlling controlling multiple character cards (likely 3 to 5).

### Objectives
The game may ultimately be designed around either simply defeating the other player in combat or in achieving objectives on some sort of game plain. In the interests of focus and balance, the game should be restricted to one of these play modes, with the exception, possibly, of the single-player campaign.

### Turns
Barring any additional sound ideas, the game will need to be either turn- or resource-based.

### Playing Field
Regardless of whether the win state is dependent upon achieving objectives or depleting the opposing characters' HP, there should be multiple playing fields. It will need to be determined whether the playing fields are random, selected, or dependent somehow on cards.


## Design

### User Interface
To be determined.

### Art Style
To be determined.

### Numbers
The mathematical components of gameplay (attack and defense calculations, etc.) will be transparent. This will allow players to understand easily how in-game calculations are made.

### Randomness
There will be some random components to gameplay but not so heavily so that they dramatically affect a player's chance of winning. Rather, the randomness should test the player's ability to adapt during the course of a game. It should also provide a way for occasional outlandish events.

### Theme
Card-collecting games seem to work best in the fantasy genre. This will likely remain the case for this project, though hopefully it will take a unique slant to differentiate itself, theme-wise, from other games of this type.

Perhaps, given the working name of the project ("Armored Squid"), the game can take on nautical thematic elements.

### Tone
The game will take on a serious tone with quirky highlights.
